# Java-TwitchBot
It's a bot for twitch IRC

It's now refactored. You can add new bot accounts in the accounts.cfg
They will be automatically loaded when the bot starts. 

Modules are on the way. 

Feel free to try out the bot in any way you'd like. The more testers, the more bugs I can fix.

Ignore most of the documentation for the time being. I haven't had the time to update it since the refactor.
